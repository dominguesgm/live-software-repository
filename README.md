# Live Software Repository

Combination of 3 separate elements to extract metadata from the code and execution of Java projects, and make it available for any other tool to make use of it.

These components are:

 * [Static Code Analyser](static-analyser/)
 * [Runtime Analyser](runtime-analyser/)
 * [Repository](repository/)

This project was developed as part of my Master Thesis in 2018.

A paper for which this thesis was one of the bases was [published](http://insticc.org/node/TechnicalProgram/enase/presentationDetails/76998) at ENASE 2019.

**Note:** these projects were previously stored in three different repositories. They have been deleted and now reside solely on this monorepo.
